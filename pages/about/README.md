> Tell me about yourself!

I've always had a thing for computers ever since I could remember

It's always been the software department that I have been attached to

So here I am, working with Frontends and Backends almost every day!

> Thats cool, what do you work with?

For the backend, I mostly use NodeJS, as I'm pretty happy with it and don't require anything more.

As for the frontend, I go with the classic, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
